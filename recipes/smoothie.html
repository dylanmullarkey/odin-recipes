    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> The triple berry smoothie is a perfect drink for a hot summer day! Combining several fruits gives it a tangy flavor, which is sweetened with the vanilla yogurt. This recipe takes no longer than 5 minutes to make, so it's perfect for a quick snack.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 cups of frozen mixed berries</li>
        <li> 1.5 cups of apple juice</li>
        <li> 1 large bananna diced </li>
        <li> 1 spoon of vanilla yogurt </li>
        <li> Optional: 1/2 cup of oats </li>
        <li> Optional: Peanut butter or honey </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Put 2 cups of frozen berries into the blender, as well as your bannana. Make sure to cut it into smaller slices. If you want to add oats, make sure to put this in before the fruit and blend until it's a dust consistency.</li>
        <li> Next, add the apple juice. </li>
        <li> Finally, add your vanilla yogurt and any other optional ingredients. Blend well.</li>
        <li> If the smoothie tastes too bitter, add in more yogurt.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> That's it! This is my go to recipe for making smoothies all summer long. I hope you enjoy as much as I do! </p>
