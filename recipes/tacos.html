        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> Tacos are a great meal for a family, as you can customize them however you want. This may not be the most authetic way, but it's easy to make and can feed several people. </p>
    
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1lb. lean ground beef</li>
            <li>Taco shells/tortillas</li>
            <li>Optional:</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Tomatos</li>
            <li>Taco Sauce</li>
            <li>Hot Sauce</li>
            <li>Sour Cream</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Unwrap your beef and put it into a pan on medium-high heat. Cook as long as needed until all meat is brown. </li>
            <li> Once done, there will be a lot of grease in the pan. If you have a big spoon, you can seperate this and put the grease in the trash. Do not pour it down your sink.</li>
            <li> Prepare any other ingredients you want to use. </li>
            <li> You are done! If you are using tortillas, it's a good idea to throw them in the microwave for 10 seconds to have some warm burritos</li>
        </ol>
        <p> I hope you enjoy as much as I do! </p>
